# Retail-Product-Management-System

Created a clone of Twitter using Spring Boot as the backend Angular as frontend and deployed in AWS with DynamoDb as the database. It has the functionality of signing in and logging in and then a user can add, edit, delete, like and comment on tweets and search for another user using their userId or emailId.
